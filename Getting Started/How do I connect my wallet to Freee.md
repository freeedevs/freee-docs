# How do I connect my wallet to Freee?

Connecting your wallet.

To connect your account on Freee, you must have a crypto wallet ready to connect; Freee currently supports wallets such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/), [Coinbase Wallet](https://wallet.coinbase.com/) and any [WalletConnect-compatible wallet](https://explorer.walletconnect.com/?type=wallet).

Once your wallet is ready to connect, you can do this via the [Freee homepage](https://freee.xyz/).

1. Click on the **"Connect"** button on the top right corner of the page.
2. Select your wallet type.
