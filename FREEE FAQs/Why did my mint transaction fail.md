# Why did my mint transaction fail?

## Why did my mint fail, and I didn't receive my NFT?

There are a few reasons why your transaction may have failed while trying to mint on Freee. Network issues or incorrect gas estimates can cause these transaction failures. 

If your mint transactions have failed multiple times, then please get in touch with our support team.

## Why was I still charged for a failed transaction?

When a transaction fails, you are still required to pay the gas fee, although you will NOT have to pay the Freee mint fee.

## Why is my transaction stuck as "Pending"?

If your transaction is stuck as "Pending", we recommend looking through the support documentation and guides on the Etherscan website, which can be found [here](https://info.etherscan.com/how-to-cancel-ethereum-pending-transactions/).
