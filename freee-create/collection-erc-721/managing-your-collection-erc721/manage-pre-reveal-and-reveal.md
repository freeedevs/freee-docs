# Manage Pre-reveal & Reveal

**About Pre-reveal & Reveal:**

Sometimes, creator/project owner don’t reveal their artwork until after the project mint out. When user participate in the collection mint, the NFT everyone mints will at first look the same, which is placeholder pre-reveal artwork. The “real” NFT metadata and artwork will be “revealed” afterward when the creator/project owner upload and update the collection NFT’s metadata.
