## Mint Referral Reward

### What is the Mint Referral Reward?

Mint Referral Reward is intended to incentivise individuals who discover and promote a NFT mint page - whether through social media like X (Twitter), Discord, or other platforms. As long as the the NFT was created using Freee's Creator Toolkit, you earn the reward automatically when mint come through.

You can earn maximum 20% from the platform fee each time an NFT is minted through a link you share or embedded mint on your website. This applies to mints completed on Freee directly or on an alternative platform.
