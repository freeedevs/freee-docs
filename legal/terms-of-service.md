# Terms of Service

Last updated: December 27, 2023

These Terms of Service (these "Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“you”), and Freee Labs(“Freee,” “we,” or “us,” and together with “you,” the “Parties” and each individually, a “Party”), concerning your access to and use of the [freee.xyz](https://freee.xyz) websites, along with our related websites, hosted applications, mobile or other downloadable applications, as well as any other technology and services provided by us (collectively, the “Services”).&#x20;

**PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS CAREFULLY:**

BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT,” OR BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND, AS A CONDITION TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY, THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING FREEE’S [PRIVACY POLICY](privacy-policy.md), AND THE FREEE NETWORK SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS (TOGETHER, THESE “TERMS”). IF YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE, OR DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS, THEN YOU DO NOT HAVE OUR PERMISSION TO USE THE SERVICES. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND FREEE’S PROVISION OF THE SERVICES TO YOU, CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT BY FREEE AND BY YOU TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.

If you have any questions about the Services or these Terms please contact us at [app@freee.xyz](mailto:app@freee.xyz).

## **1. SERVICES OVERVIEW.**&#x20;

The Services allow you to leverage public blockchain networks to discover, explore, and NFTs (defined below), to build tools and communities around your NFT projects, and to connect with others on a peer-to-peer basis to buy, sell, and transfer NFTs.

## **2. ELIGIBILITY**.&#x20;

You must be at least 18 years of age to use the Services. If you are under 18 but at least 13 years old, you may only use the Services through a parent or guardian’s account and with their approval and oversight. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that: (i) you are at least 18 years old; (ii) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Services; (iii) your registration and your use of the Services is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations; and (iv) if you are the parent or guardian of a user under the age of 18 (a “Minor”), that you are accepting these Terms on behalf of such Minor, authorizing such Minor to use the Services pursuant to the account you’ve established on the Services, and remain liable for all activities of the Minor arising out of the Minor’s use of the Services. If you are an entity, organization, or company, the individual accepting these Terms on your behalf represents and warrants that they have authority to bind you to these Terms and you agree to be bound by these Terms.

## 3. ACCESSING THE SERVICES.&#x20;

To access most features of the Services, you will be required to  create or connect a digital cryptocurrency wallet (“Wallet”) (such as MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet) to the Services to create an account. Your Wallet address may be publicly displayed on the Services when you connect your Wallet, and you consent to such public display. For additional information about your account and profile data, please see our [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md).

## 4. WALLETS.

**4.1. Access.** The Services access public data from the blockchain related to your Wallet to enable you to use your Wallet to facilitate sales and purchases of NFTs, and to verify your ownership of certain NFTs, verify your account, and otherwise provide the intended functionality of the Services.

**4.2. Your Wallet.** By connecting a Wallet, including a Privy Wallet (as defined below) to the Services, you agree to abide by the terms and conditions of the applicable Wallet provider. You must familiarize yourself with the terms of use, technology, and security protocols of any Wallet. We do not provide a crypto-wallet service and do not at any time have custody, possession, or control over your NFTs, crypto assets, or any other contents in your Wallet. You acknowledge and agree that we are not party to any transactions conducted while using our Services. We make no representations or warranties regarding how the Services will operate or be compatible with any specific Wallet. The private keys necessary to access the assets held in a Wallet are not held by the Company. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your Wallet, including your credentials, private key, and/or seed phrase. We are in no way liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with your Wallet or as a result of your Wallet being compromised. You should make contingency plans with respect to your Wallet in the event of your death or incapacity, otherwise you (and your executor, guardian, or heirs) may lose access to your Wallet, your account on the Services, and your NFTs.

**4.3. Assistance.** If you notice any unauthorized or suspicious activity in Wallets that are related or linked to the Services, please notify us immediately at [app@freee.xyz](mailto:app@freee.xyz). However, Freee shall have no duty or obligation to assist you in connection with such activity related to a Wallet, including if you are unable to locate your Wallet credentials.

## 5. SERVICES AND PROTOCOLS.

**5.1. The Services and Freee Protocol**. The Freee Protocol is an NFT platform protocol that was developed by Freee and is available alongside the Services (the “Freee Protocol”). The Services allow users to: (i) create non-fungible cryptographic tokens that represent unique pieces of media (each an “NFT”); (ii) publish (or “mint”) NFTs to a blockchain; (iii) buy and sell NFTs on the Services; and (iv) develop projects that run on the Freee Protocol. The Services provide one method for accessing the Freee Protocol, but are not the only way to do so. For clarity, the defined term “Services” does not include the Freee Protocol.

**5.2. Creating NFTs.** Our creator toolkit, available at [freee.xyz](https://freee.xyz) (the “Creator Toolkit”), allows users to create and launch NFT collections on Supported Networks using the Freee Protocol. Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, Freee grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to access and use the Creator Toolkit solely for the purpose of creating, publishing, and minting NFTs. For more information regarding the Creator Toolkit. As Freee lacks the ability to control how a third party may use the Creator Toolkit and Freee Protocol, nothing in this Section 5.2 is intended to imply that the Creator Toolkit and Freee Protocol prohibit a third party from making unauthorized reproductions of the content of an NFT (e.g., an unauthorized screen capture), and the owner of any intellectual property rights in an NFT is solely responsible for enforcement of such rights.

* **5.2.1. Fees for Creating.** There are no fees paid to Freee for creating your NFTs using the Creator Toolkit. However, transactions on a Supported Network require a fee to cover the computational resources expended to execute the transaction (the “Gas Fee”). You are responsible for paying the Gas Fees associated with minting an NFT with the Creator Toolkit. Gas Fees are necessary to support each Supported Network.
* **5.2.2. Fees On Primary Sales/Mints.** As noted in Section 5.2.1, Freee does not charge any fees for using the Creator Toolkit merely to create and make available NFT collections to others for minting. However, Freee does charge the minting party a fee (the “Minting Fee”) for minting NFT collections launched using the Creator Toolkit ("Creator NFTs"). Freee does not charge a fee for the minting of Third-Party NFTs (defined below).  For clarity, the minting party may be the creator or the initial purchaser of the NFT. You agree to pay the Minting Fee if you mint an NFT using the Services. Freee will display the Minting Fee, including a breakdown of the distribution of the Minting Fee, to you prior to you confirming your decision to mint or make an initial purchase of an NFT, as applicable.&#x20;
* **5.3.3. Responsibility for Your NFTs.** You are solely responsible for the NFTs you create using the Creator Toolkit, including for clearing the rights to any third-party content included in your NFTs, including the rights of privacy and publicity, and for any third-party claims of copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property infringement or violation of any rights of privacy or publicity. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Freee and its officers, directors, employees, shareholders, creditors, lenders, lawyers, advisors, insurers, predecessors, successors, affiliates, and assigns (collectively, “Freee Parties”), harmless from and against any and all damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from the minting, sale, reproduction, distribution, public display, public performance, communication to the public, advertising, marketing, promoting or other use or exploitation of your NFTs.

**5.4. Enjoy NFTs.** The Services includes an aggregation functionality (the “Feed”) that allows you to view and discover newly-released NFTs, including Creator NFTs and NFTs that were created on third-party websites, third-party NFT marketplaces, or sources other than the Services (each a “Third-Party Source,” and such NFTs from Third-Party Sources, “Third-Party NFTs”). You may also be able to mint NFTs that you find on the Feed, as further discussed in Sections 5.4.2 and 5.4.3 below. For clarity, the Feed only displays NFTs that are or were available for minting (including mints that have sold out or are otherwise no longer open or active) and does not display any NFTs offered for resale .

* **5.4.1. Content from Third-Party Sources.** All content from Third-Party Sources, including, without limitation, Third-Party NFTs and all listing information and pricing for such Third-Party NFTs, constitutes Third-Party Materials (defined in Section 13 below). Without limiting any other provision of these Terms, your use of such Third-Party Materials is subject to any third-party terms and conditions governing such Third-Party Materials, and you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for and assume all risk arising from your use of Third-Party Materials. We do not have control over, warrant, or endorse Third-Party Sources or the content thereon, and we are not responsible for the availability or legitimacy of the content, Third-Party NFTs, products, or services on or accessible from Third-Party Sources (including any related websites, resources or links displayed therein). If you access a Third-Party Source, including via a link from the Service, your access to and use of such Third-Party Source is governed by the terms and conditions of such Third-Party Source. Freee does not guarantee that any NFTs visible or accessible on the Feed will always remain visible or accessible.
* **5.4.2. Transactions Involving Third-Party NFTs.** You may be able to use the Feed to mint Third-Party NFTs. You are responsible for verifying the legitimacy, authenticity, and functionality of any Third-Party NFTs that you mint through the Feed. Any transactions concerning Third-Party NFTs that you engage in, including minting Third-Party NFTs, are subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Third-Party Source and/or the terms set by the applicable creator. If a Third-Party Source charges a fee for minting a Third-Party NFT (a “Third-Party Fee”), we will use commercially reasonable efforts to incorporate such Third-Party Fee into the mint price surfaced to you in the Feed based on the onchain mint contract for the underlying Third-Party NFT. Freee has no control over these transactions or any payments that you make with respect to such transactions, nor does Freee have the ability to reverse any such payments or transactions. In some cases, Freee may receive referral fees from Third-Party Sources for surfacing Third-Party NFTs on the Feed that are ultimately minted on the Services. In such cases, the referral fee will be taken out of the Third-Party Fee and will not change the underlying mint price. You are not entitled to any portion of such referral fees. Freee is not a party to these transactions, and Freee has no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any payments or transactions that you engage in through Third-Party Sources or concerning Third-Party NFTs.
* **5.4.3. Fees Associated with the Feed.** As noted in Section 5.2.2, Freee charges a Minting Fee for minting NFTs created using the Creator Toolkit, including any minting associated with primary sales. Freee does not charge fees for Third-Party NFTs minted through the Feed. Please note that you may also owe fees or royalties to third parties for minting NFTs through the Feed, subject to any applicable Third-Party Source's terms and conditions or the terms set by the applicable creator, though such fees shall typically be included in the NFT's list price on the Feed.

**6.4. Feedback.** We respect and appreciate the thoughts and comments from our users. If you choose to provide input and suggestions regarding existing functionalities, problems with or proposed modifications or improvements to the Services (“Feedback”), then you hereby grant Freee an unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free right and license to exploit the Feedback in any manner and through any means now known or hereafter created, and for any purpose, throughout the universe, including to improve the Services and create other products and services. We will have no obligation to provide you with attribution or compensation for any Feedback you provide to us.

**6.5. Your Rights.** Except for the licenses granted by you to Freee, you retain all rights in and to your User Content (defined below), as between you and us.

## 7. USER CONTENT.

**7.1. Limited License Grant to Freee**. By submitting, uploading, publishing, storing, broadcasting, minting or otherwise transmitting (collectively, “Posting”) Content to or through the Services (“User Content”), you grant us an unrestricted, assignable, sublicensable, revocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up license throughout the universe to reproduce, distribute, publicly display, communicate to the public, publicly perform (including by means of digital audio transmissions and on a through-to-the-audience basis), make available, create derivative works from, retransmit, and otherwise exploit and use all or any part of such User Content by any means and through any media and formats, whether now known or hereafter developed, for the purposes of: (i) advertising, marketing and promoting Freee, the Services, and the availability of your User Content on the Services; (ii) displaying and sharing your User Content to other users of the Services; and (iii) providing, operating, and improving the Services as authorized by these Terms. All of the rights you grant in these Terms are provided on a through-to-the-audience basis, meaning the owners or operators of external services will not have any separate liability to you or any other third party for User Content Posted or otherwise used on external services via the Services. For clarity, Freee does not claim any ownership of User Content and has no right to use User Content other than in accordance with these terms or otherwise absent your express permission. You agree to pay all monies owing to any person or entity resulting from Posting your User Content and from Freee’s exercise of the license set forth in this Section.

**7.2. Specific Rules for Photographs and Images.** If you Post a photograph or image to the Services that includes one or more persons, you hereby grant such persons and their administrators, guardians, heirs, and trustees, if any, an irrevocable, perpetual, royalty free, fully paid-up, worldwide license to reproduce, distribute, and publicly display that photograph for personal use and through any online platform or service, including the Services, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, but not to promote any third-party product, good, or service. The license contained in this Section does not permit the subject of any photo or their administrators, guardians, heirs, or trustees to sell that image or photograph, whether on a standalone basis or as embodied in any product. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 7.2 only applies to the extent there is not a conflicting agreement between the photographer and the subject(s) of the photo. You and the subject of any photograph or other original work of authorship you Post to the Services are free to negotiate terms and conditions to supersede the provisions of this Section 7.2.

**7.3. Specific Rules for Musical Works and for Recording Artists.** If you are a composer or author of a musical work and have granted non-exclusive rights to a Performing Rights Organization (“PRO”), then you must notify your PRO of the royalty-free license you grant through these Terms to Freee. You are solely responsible for ensuring your compliance with the relevant PRO’s reporting obligations. If you have assigned your rights to a music publisher or a PRO, then you must obtain the consent of that music publisher or PRO to grant the royalty-free license(s) set forth in these Terms or have that music publisher or PRO enter into these Terms with Freee. Just because you authored a musical work (e.g., wrote a song) does not mean you have the right to grant Freee the licenses in these Terms. If you are a recording artist under contract with a record label, then you are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Services is in compliance with any contractual obligations you have to your record label, including if you create any new recordings through the Services that may be claimed by your label. Finally, if you wish to perform a cover song and Post it to the Services, you are responsible for securing all rights in and to the underlying musical work before Posting your recording or performance of that musical work to the Services.

* 7.3.1. IF YOU CREATE AND DISTRIBUTE AN NFT THAT INCLUDES A SOUND RECORDING, AND THE MUSICAL WORK EMBODIED THEREIN, OR AN AUDIOVISUAL WORK EMBODYING A SOUND RECORDING AND A MUSICAL WORK, THEN SUCH MUSICAL WORKS, SOUND RECORDINGS, AND AUDIOVISUAL WORKS MAY BE AVAILABLE THROUGH ANY PLATFORM OR TOOLS THAT ACCESS THE APPLICABLE BLOCKCHAIN ON WHICH THE NFT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED.

**7.4. You Must Have Rights to the Content You Post; User Content Representations and Warranties.** You must not Post any User Content that violates these Terms or for which you do not have all the rights necessary to grant the licenses described herein. You represent and warrant that your User Content, the source and underlying materials used in creating the User Content, and our use of such content as permitted by these Terms, will not violate any rights of or cause injury to any person or entity. Freee disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Content. You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of providing User Content via the Services. By providing User Content via the Services, you affirm, represent, and warrant to us that:

* 7.4.1. you are the creator and owner of the User Content, or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to authorize Freee and users of the Services to use and distribute your User Content as necessary to exercise the licenses granted by you in this Section, in the manner contemplated by Freee, the Services, and these Terms;
* 7.4.2. your User Content, and the Posting or other use of your User Content as contemplated by these Terms, does not and will not: (i) infringe, violate, misappropriate, or otherwise breach any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property, contract, or proprietary right; (ii) slander, defame, libel, or invade the right of privacy, publicity or other property rights of any other person; or (iii) cause Freee to violate any law or regulation or require us to obtain any further licenses from or pay any royalties, fees, compensation or other amounts or provide any attribution to any third parties; and

**7.5. User Content Disclaimer.** We are under no obligation to edit or control User Content that you or other users Post and will not be in any way responsible or liable for User Content. Freee may, however, at any time and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block any User Content that in our sole judgment violates these Terms, is alleged to violate the rights of third parties, or is otherwise objectionable. You understand that, when using the Services, you will be exposed to User Content from a variety of sources and acknowledge that User Content may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable. You agree to waive, and do waive, any legal or equitable right or remedy you have or may have against Freee with respect to User Content. If notified by a user or content owner that User Content allegedly does not conform to these Terms, we may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion whether to remove the User Content, which we reserve the right to do at any time and without notice. For clarity, Freee does not permit infringing activities on the Services.

**7.6. Monitoring Content.** Freee does not control and does not have any obligation to monitor: (i) User Content; (ii) any content made available by third parties; or (iii) the use of the Services by its users. You acknowledge and agree that Freee reserves the right to, and may from time to time, monitor any and all information transmitted or received through the Services for operational and other purposes. If at any time Freee chooses to monitor the content, then Freee still assumes no responsibility or liability for content or any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of content. During monitoring, information may be examined, recorded, copied, and used in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md)[ ](privacy-policy.md)(defined below). Freee may block, filter, mute, remove or disable access to any User Content uploaded to or transmitted through the Services without any liability to the user who Posted such User Content to the Services or to any other users of the Services.

## **8.ACCESSING AND USING THE SERVICES**

**9.3. Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement.** If you believe that Content residing on or accessible through the Services has been used or exploited in a manner that infringes an intellectual property right you own or control, please promptly notify us by sending a written “Notification of Claimed Infringement” to our Designated Agent identified above containing the following information:

* 9.3.1. identification and a description of the Content on the Services that is claimed to be infringing, including URLs where such Content can be found;

* 9.3.6. an electronic or autograph signature (which can be a scanned copy) of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other right being infringed.

Your Notification of Claimed Infringement may be shared by Freee with the user alleged to have infringed a right you own or control as well as with the operators of publicly available databases that track notifications of claimed infringement, and you consent to Freee making such disclosures.&#x20;

**9.4. Repeat Infringers.** It is Freee’s policy to: (i) remove or disable access to Content that Freee believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property rights owner or authorized agent, is infringing the intellectual property rights of a third party by being made available through the Services; (ii) notify the user who Posted the Content to the Services, that access to such Content has been removed or disabled; and (iii) in appropriate circumstances, terminate the accounts of and block access to the Services for any user who repeatedly or egregiously infringes other people’s copyright or other intellectual property rights. If you find Content that you believe violates your intellectual property rights, or otherwise violates these Terms or applicable laws, please notify us in accordance with Section 9.2 (_DMCA Notification_).

**9.5.

**9.7. False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications.** The Copyright Act provides at 17 U.S.C. § 512(f) that: “\[a]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under \[Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of \[Freee] relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.” Freee reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a Notification of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notification in violation of the law.
