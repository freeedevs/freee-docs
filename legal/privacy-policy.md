If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you have certain rights regarding your personal information and may ask us to take the following actions in relation to your personal information that we hold:

* Access. Provide you with information about our processing of your personal information and give you access to your personal information.
* Correct. Update or correct inaccuracies in your personal information.

You also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority.

You can find their contact details here: [http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index\_en.htm](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index\_en.htm).

If you are a resident of the United States, you may also have certain rights under the laws of your state. For example, if you are a California resident, you may have certain rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) with respect to information collected by us during the 12 months preceding your request. These include the right to (i) request access to, details regarding, and a copy of the personal information we have collected about you and/or shared with third parties; (ii) request deletion of the personal information that we have collected about you; and (iii) the right to opt-out of sale of your personal information. As the terms are defined under the CCPA, we do not “sell” your “personal information.”

California residents may also request the following information (to the extent we share your personal information in this way):

* the categories of information we disclosed to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year; and
* the names and addresses of third parties that received such information, or if the nature of their business cannot be determined from the name, then examples of the products or services marketed.

To exercise your privacy rights, please contact us at [app@freee.xyz](mailto:app@freee.xyz).

Notwithstanding the above, we cannot edit or delete any information that is stored on a blockchain.

## 12. YOUR CONTROLS AND CHOICES

You have the following choices with respect to your personal information:

* “Do Not Track.” Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.
*   Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising. You may stop or restrict the placement of Technologies on your device or remove them by adjusting your preferences as your browser or device permits. However, if you adjust your preferences, our Services may not work properly. Please note you must separately opt out in each browser and on each device. Instructions on how to edit your cookie settings on various browsers and platforms are listed as follows: [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/260971/description-of-cookies), [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en-GB), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cookies-information-websites-store-on-your-computer), [Safari Desktop](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/manage-cookies-and-website-data-sfri11471/mac), [Safari Mobile](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), and [Android browser](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/54068?visit\_id=637284515772371005-3491757126\&hl=en\&rd=1). You can find more information about how to change your browser cookie settings at [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

    There are also additional tools available to manage third party cookies.
