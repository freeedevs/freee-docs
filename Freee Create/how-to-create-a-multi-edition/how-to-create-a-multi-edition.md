# How to Create a Multi-Edition

Using Freee's Multi-Edition tool, you can add editions to a single contract and release them over time or all at once. You have complete control over how you organize and roll out your project.

There are three components to a Freee collection: the collection contract as a whole, the editions, and the individual tokens within those editions.

## Want to test out your collection?

We recommend using our [testnet](https://testnet.freee.xyz) before deploying any collection to the mainnet. Testing on the testnet provides a risk-free environment where you can ensure that your collection functions correctly and identify any potential issues before they occur on the mainnet, saving your time and ETH.
