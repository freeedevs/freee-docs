## 2. Managing your Collection and Editions

There are "**TWO**" levels of settings that you can manage within your collection.

1. The first is your overall collection. _(This is where all your editions live)_
2. The second is the individual editions that you have uploaded.

In your settings, you can currently update and change the metadata of your **collection** and your **editions**. For your individual editions, you can also create airdrops and allowlists.

While viewing the overview page of your collection, you can **Add/Modify your Twitter username**, view your **current contract version number**, **treasury balance**, all of the **editions within your collection**, and the option to "**Add a new NFT to this collection**".

To update your collection, navigate to the **“Settings”** tab. From here, you can update your collection **name**, **description**, **thumbnail** and **Admins**.

#### 2.2.2 Manage your Airdrop

1. At the NFT Dashboard, go to the Airdrop section.
2. Write the wallet addresses you want to airdrop to, separating them with a comma (,) or a return. Click "Airdrop (x) NFT" and approve the transaction to complete the process.

If you'd like to start over, click on Reset, and all of the wallets added will be deleted.

#### 2.2.3 Manage your Allowlist

If you want to make a pre-sale or give different mint prices to specific wallets, you can create an **Allowlist**. In order to create an allowlist you can follow our quick guide below

1. Go to the Allowlist section and select "Add Items".
2. Select between uploading a CSV file with all the names (check the example when clicking) or adding them manually, separating each wallet by a comma (,), or return.
3. Add the wallet addresses you'd like to add, the pricing, and the mint limit per address, and click on "Add items" to finalize your choices.

**You can create multiple Allowlists for different prices, mint limits, and addresses.**

Once you are satisfied with the changes you have made:

1. Click **update**.
2. Approve the Gas fee: A message will appear within your connected wallet for you to approve the gas fee to complete the update of your collection. Gas fees are the cost of interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. Gas fees are not set or collected by Freee.
3. Once the transaction has been confirmed, your changes/updates will be saved on-chain.
