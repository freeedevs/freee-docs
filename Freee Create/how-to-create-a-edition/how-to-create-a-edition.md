# How to create a Edition

Using Freee's Edition tool, you can add editions to a single contract and release them over time or all at once. You have complete control over how you organize and roll out your project.

## Creating your Edition (ERC-721)

At Freee, our mission is to make it as easy and enjoyable as possible for creators to bring their imagination and creativity onchain. It's now even easier to realize value for your work on Freee with just an Ethereum wallet!
