# How to create a Edition

Using Freee's Edition tool, you can add editions to a single contract and release them over time or all at once. You have complete control over how you organize and roll out your project.

## Want to test out your collection?

We recommend using our [testnet](https://testnet.freee.xyz) before deploying any collection to the mainnet. Testing on the testnet provides a risk-free environment where you can ensure that your collection functions correctly and identify any potential issues before they occur on the mainnet, saving your time and ETH.

## Creating your Edition (ERC-721)

At Freee, our mission is to make it as easy and enjoyable as possible for creators to bring their imagination and creativity onchain. It's now even easier to realize value for your work on Freee with just an Ethereum wallet!
