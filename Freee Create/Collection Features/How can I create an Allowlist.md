# How can I create an Allowlist?

## What is an Allowlist?

An allowlist, also known as a presale, is a list of selected wallet addresses that give certain community members early access to mint from your collection. Early access can also involve a free or cheaper price than when the mint is available to the public.

There are two ways that you are able to create an allowlist for your collection on Freee:

1. The first is to create one in your collection's settings. Follow our step-by-step guide below.
2. You can access our technical resource docs here and create one.

***

## Create your Allowlist

To create an allowlist, your edition must be onchain (minted from). You CANNOT create an allowlist from a premint edition. Once your edition has been brought onchain, you will be able to access the allowlist feature.

1. To begin, you'll need to access your edition settings, which can be done by navigating through your [Dashboard](https://freee.xyz/manage).
2. Once into your edition settings, follow through the top tab that says "**Allowlist**".
3. Select "Add Items"
4. There are two ways to upload your allowlist for your collection.
   1. **Manual Entry**.
      1. Recommended for simple allowlists with a size of 10 to 20 addresses
   2. **Upload a CSV file**.
      1. Recommended for larger or more complicated allowlists with 20+ addresses.

Continue with our step-by-step guide below to upload your allowlist.

## Manual Entry

If you are adding a small number of wallet addresses (\~20) to your allowlist, we recommend doing so through our manual entry form. To quickly add these items, you can follow our steps below:

1. Select "Add Items"
2. Enter the **Wallet Addresses** of the accounts for your allowlist. â€‹
3. Set the **price** for ALL these accounts.
   1. If you would like to have differing prices for different addresses, then you will need to do the manual entry process multiple times. â€‹
4. Set a **mint limit** for these addresses. â€‹
5. Confirm your changes. â€‹
6. Set your allowlist period live by selecting "**Save onchain**" and confirming the transaction in your wallet.

## CSV Upload

The second option to create your allowlist is to upload a file using the "**CSV Upload**" option. This is a great option for larger and more complicated allowlists that can have thousands of entries. To add your CSV file, follow along below:

![](../../imgs/allowlist\_2.gif)

1. Select "**Add Items**" â€‹
2. Choose "**CSV Upload**"
3. Upload your CSV file. â€‹
   1. When formatting your CSV, ensure that there are NO titles or headers. You only need your **Wallet Addresses**, **Price** and **Mint Limit**. â€‹
4. Review your upload
5. Set your allowlist period live by selecting "**Save onchain**" and confirming the transaction in your wallet.
