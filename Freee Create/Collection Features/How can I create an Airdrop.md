# How can I create an Airdrop?

**DISCLAIMER: Abuse of this tool will result in your edition being blocked from Freee. DO NOT send NFTs to a mass volume of addresses without their consent.**

To create an airdrop, your edition must be onchain (minted from). You CANNOT create an airdrop from a premint edition. Once your edition has been brought onchain you will be able to access the airdrop feature. This feature allows you to send one NFT to another address without them needing to mint or pay for it.
