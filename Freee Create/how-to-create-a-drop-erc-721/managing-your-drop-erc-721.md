You **can** update the thumbnail, description and sales configuration.

\*_Please note that anyone classified as an **ADMIN** can update and change this data_ \*

## Managing Permissions

As owner/admin of a drop, you can update and change the permissions to your collection. This includes **payout address**, **managing permissions** of admin access and the ability to **transfer ownership** to another wallet address.

Once you are satisfied with the changes you have made

* Click "**update**" or "**transfer**" under the appropriate section
* Approve the Gas fee: A message will appear within your connected wallet for you to approve the gas fee to complete the update of your drop. Gas fees are the cost of interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. Gas fees are not set or collected by Freee.
* Wait for your transaction to complete: Once youâ€™ve approved the transaction within your wallet, the update process has begun. You can check the status of your upload by clicking the "View on Etherscan" link in your connected wallet.
* Once the transaction has been confirmed, your changes/updates will be made.
