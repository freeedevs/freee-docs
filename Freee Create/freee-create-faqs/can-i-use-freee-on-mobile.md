## Additional Information

While going through this process of connecting your Metamask wallet to create.freee.xyz, you may experience a technical error that sends you to the Apple App Store instead of your Metamask app; this may be despite having it already downloaded onto your device.

This is a common error many users experience with various applications and the Apple App store; unfortunately, there is currently **no** solution.
